# AWS Lambda R Runtime with Spatial Libraries

This `Dockerfile` builds a container running a custom AWS Lambda Runtime for R on Amazon Linux 2 that also includes the spatial libraries for GEOS, PROJ, and GDAL. It uses [jsinghm/aws-lambda-r](https://github.com/program--/Dockerfiles/tree/master/aws-lambda-r) as the base container.

# Usage
