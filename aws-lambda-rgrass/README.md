# AWS Lambda R Runtime with GRASS GIS

This `Dockerfile` builds a container running a custom AWS Lambda Runtime for R on Alpine Linux that includes the spatial libraries for GEOS, PROJ, and GDAL, and comes with GRASS GIS 7.8 and `rgrass7`. This container uses `jsinghm/aws-lambda-rspatial` as the base container.

# Usage
